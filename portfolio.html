                                survey. I noted things like which colors made people calm and about what they want from
                                a mindfulness app. Based on that, I worked on the app for a couple of weeks before
                                handing it in.</span>

                            <span>The assignemnt was to visualize an onomatopoetic word based on how it sounds. I chose
                                the word "wroom" since I thought it would be really cool to make something with a car. I
                                therefore positioned a car in a wat htat it looks like it's drifting. I then picked a
                                font that gave of the same feeling as "screech", which I thought would be a thicker one.
                                I warped it so it looked like it was kinda stuck in the asphalt but at the same time
                                moved with the smoke.</span>

                            <span>I wanted to create a car poster since I had seen many of them recently and got
                                inspired. I wanted to go for a sleak and simple theme and therefore wanted a car with a
                                likewise design. The Porsche 911 felt like the best option since it has a mix of sharp
                                and round shapes. For the colors, I tried to only use the colors that was on the car. It
                                was important for me to not make it feel too cluttered and point most focus on the car.
                                I think I achieved that by using a lot fo whitespace and having the car being the
                                biggest element.</span>

                            <span>In photo class, we had a lession assignemnt to take a product photography. I found an
                                empty coke can and thought it would be a good idea since it containes a very strong
                                color. I also amplified that by choosing a gray background, which made the can stand out
                                even more. Since the main focus was on taking a picture, and there wasn't much time
                                left, I just slapped the coke logo on there and used Snickers slogan since this part
                                wasn't serious. </span>

                            <span>This was at the time the biggest project I had worked on. I made it in UX/UI interface
                                class and the brief was to redesign parts of any app of our choice. I had allready
                                noticed that TikTok had a lot of flaws and questionable things in their interface and
                                therefore, I chose this app.</span>

                            <span>I started of by going thrugh other social platform apps, searching for inspiration but
                                also things I didn't want. I then went on to create a moodboard where I collected theese
                                different apps and also images that matched TikToks aesthetic. The project spanned over
                                several weeks and I went forward and backward trying to perfect it. At the end of the
                                project, I felt saticfied with the result and I think the app became much simpeler while
                                still keeping it's original style.</span>
